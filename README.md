# Some Game Name
This contains the code for a [Pokemon-based dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon) game. Loosely inspired by the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series, this was written entirely in assembly for the course EECS 205: Fundamentals of Computer Systems Software.

## Game description
You control a Pokemon who has been dropped into a dungeon. It is your job to find the stairs to the next floor, and eventually to the end of the dungeon. Along the way, though, you might run into other Pokemon -- and they won't be so friendly.

## Gameplay
 * Use **arrow keys** to control player motion. 
 * Use **spacebar** to attack.

## Current next steps
 * Make a full-sized level background
 * Control player movement along the level
 * Control item and enemy generation along the level
